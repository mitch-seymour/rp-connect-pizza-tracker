# RP Connect Pizza Tracker

You just bought a pizza restaurant, nice!

Now you want to implement a pizza tracker. You're a Redpanda customer so you have access to state of the art streaming tech. Let's get started.

- Producing the data directly from our backend application that processes orders
- Using Redpanda Connect to listen for changes in Postgresql and automatically produce the data to Redpanda

Let's go with the second option. To do so, we need
